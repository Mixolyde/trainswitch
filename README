Erlang solution to a fun Artifical Intelligence homework assignment

The assignment can be found online at:

http://www.cis.udel.edu/~decker/courses/681s07/prog1.html

To run from erlang shell:
 1. cd("repo_directory").
 2. make:all([load]).
 3. ts_unit_test:unit_test().

The problem yard structures are defined in trainswitch.hrl.

trainswitch has some of the utility functions that build-up to the solution as part
of the homework assignment, and the iterative-deepenening search that works well for
the first few small problems.

ts_util contains some more utility methods for manipulating data structures.

ts_astar has the astar heuristic solution which solves the big yards quite quickly,
using a combination of dijkstra's algorithm for calculating distances from tracks
and an out of order check that penalizes moves that would put cars on a track out of
order from the goal state

dls_proc was an attempt to solve the problem in a distributed fashion, but it hits the
maximum process count of the system pretty early, not a good plan. 

ts_unit_test contains a large list of unit_test asserts for just about every method
in the system
